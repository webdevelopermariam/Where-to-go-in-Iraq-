AI Recommendation system
Project Overview
This project is a Tourism Recommendation System designed to help users discover hotels, cafes, archaeological sites, and holy places in Iraq based on similarity and user interest.
The system uses machine learning (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) to recommend places by analyzing textual features such as name, city, category, price range, and best-for descriptions.
The final recommendations are displayed through a Streamlit web application.
